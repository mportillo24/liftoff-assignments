## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The idea is to create a community-driven field guide application for a fictitious nature park. Using the app, users will be able to upload pictures and create entries for wildlife and plants found within the park.By allowing the web app to be community-driven, the nature park promotes community-building while establishing an online presence. 

At its simplest, users without an account will be able to use the application to view single-page entries for each subject. Users will be able to use categories to pinpoint what they're looking for. A search feature will be present to be even more precise. 
A logged-in user will additionally be able to create a new entry by uploading a picture and filling out details related to the subject. 

### Features
User Login - users will be able to create an account and sign in.
Search - users will be able to search for database entries.
